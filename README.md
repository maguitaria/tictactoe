git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd tic-tac-toe-backend
```

3. Build and run the Java Spring Boot application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the game.

## Project Structure
